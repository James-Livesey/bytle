# [Bytle](https://jamesl.me/bytle)
A Wordle-like game where you have to guess the unsigned 8-bit binary number!

Game coded in 2h 14m 50.570s, but it's not like I'm counting how long it took at all! Minimum viable game in 50m 58.590s.

## Can I contribute to Bytle?
Sure, go ahead! However, we're not intending to add any more features (the code is a bit of a mess in its current form as-is), but you're welcome to fork the project. Feel free to submit any pull requests that fix bugs or other potential issues with Bytle.
