                <summary>What's the objective of the game?</summary>
                <p>
                    The objective is to guess today's Bytle number (which can be
                    in the range of 0-255 inclusive). You have 6 turns to do so,
                    and a hint is given after each turn as to what today's Bytle
                    number is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To play the game, you need to enter your guess as a base-10
                    (denary) number. Once you've entered it, the appropriate row
                    (corresponding to the current turn) will show your number in
                    binary. For each bit that's correct, the bit's cell will be
                    ðŸŸ©. If a bit is in the wrong place, then the cell will be
                    ðŸŸ¨, and if it's totally wrong, it'll be â¬œ.

                <summary>Once I've played today's Bytle, can I play another one?</summary>
                <p>
                    Yes, but you'll need to wait until tommorow to play the next
                    Bytle. It's part of the novelty of Wordle-like games â€” you
                    only get one shot at the game every day.

                <p>
                    My friend Ben and I were coming up with stupid versions of
                    Wordle after looking at
                    <a href="https://converged.yt/primel/" target="_blank">Primel</a>,
                    which is yet another clone of Wordle, but to do with
                    numbers. We thought how could we make the most
                    <em>cursed</em> version of the game â€” and that's how Bytle
                    came into existence!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some mechanics (as to how to colour in the cells) differ
                    between Wordle and Bytle, but we think that player should
                    get the gist of what the colours mean pretty quickly when
                    playing the game.

                <summary>This is stupid â€” you can literally get it in two turns!</summary>
                <p>
                    We know! Not as fun when you do it strategically, though. In
                    both Wordle and Bytle, you can even get it in one turn if
                    you're lucky enough. Regardless of strategy, you'll still be
                    learning how to mentally convert denary numbers into binary!
